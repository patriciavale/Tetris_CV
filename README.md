# Tetris 3D
A 3D Tetris in OpenGL. Made for the Visual Computation (CV) course, in University of Aveiro.

## Introduction
Tetris 3D is a game developed in OpenGL using JavaScript. The user can control a total of seven different pieces with the keyboard, which are randomly generated. The objective is to clear the most amount of lines possible, without letting it reach the top of the screen.

## Controls
To play the game, use the arrow keys to move the falling pieces.
-The **left and right keys** move the piece to the different directions.
-The **up key** rotates the piece by 90º.
-The **down key** accelarates the piece downwards.

## Credits
This project was made by Patrícia Vale and João Correia, for the Visual Computation (CV) course in University of Aveiro, in 2018.
